# DarkSwitch

A simple windows application for toggling between dark and light themes in windows 10.

## Building

The project compiles to a simple executable, which can be generated by running `dotnet publish` in the root. This will output the exe and its necessary files to the bin\Release\net5.0-windows folder.

## Use

Click the icon to toggle dark mode. Additionally, the hotkey `Win`+`/` will also trigger this behavior.
